Description: Functions for nonlinear time series analysis. This package permits 
             the estimation of the  most-used nonlinear statistics/algorithms
             including generalized correlation dimension, information dimension,
             largest Lyapunov exponent, sample entropy and Recurrence 
             Quantification Analysis (RQA), among others. Basic routines
             for surrogate data testing are also included. Part of this work 
             was based on the  book "Nonlinear time series analysis" by 
             Holger Kantz and Thomas Schreiber (ISBN: 9780521529020).
